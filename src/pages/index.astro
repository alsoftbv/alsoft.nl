        We help you build reliable, efficient embedded systems — from early
        prototypes to production-ready products.

      <p class="sub">
        At <strong>alsoft</strong>, we make sure your device does what it’s
        meant to do: collect, connect, and perform — without the crashes or
        quirks that hold great hardware back.

    <h2>You’ve built great hardware.</h2>
    <p>
      But when it freezes, misbehaves, or just won’t talk to other devices —
      people assume the whole thing is bad. We get it. Debugging firmware under
      pressure isn’t fun, and those little issues can make or break your
      product’s reputation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="solution">
    <h2>
      We bring the same care to your firmware that you bring to your hardware.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We design, test, and refine every part until it feels solid. Whether you
      need firmware from scratch or help improving what you already have, we’ll
      make sure it’s stable, efficient, and production-ready.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="proof">
    <h2>Trusted in high-stakes industries.</h2>
    <p>
      From avionics to industrial automation, we’ve built and tested systems
      where reliability isn’t optional. You can trust that what we build for you
      won’t just work — it’ll keep working.

    <h2>Hey, I’m Altuğ.</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve spent years working on embedded systems in industries where failure

      dependable products — without chasing firmware bugs at midnight.
